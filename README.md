# Plotter

_Plotter_ is an editing tool for amateur creative writers looking to be traditionally published; that is, by querying a literary agent and selling a book to a publishing house. The modern publishing industry is incredibly competitive, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, and existing writing and editing tools have significant drawbacks that have not yet been addressed.

The core design principles behind _Plotter_ are as follows:

- To provide a tool that integrates with existing word-processing software as unobtrusively as possible.
- To provide functionality beyond spelling- and grammar-checking; this will be done by presenting information to the user without offering corrections or suggestions.

Most, if not all, existing editing tools focus on spelling- and grammar-checking as their core features. While this functionality may work for academic and business English, creative writing has much looser conventions that vary depending on features such as genre and target audience. _Plotter_ takes a different approach. It uses text analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to track and display various metrics throughout a piece of work, such as readability, parts-of-speech and sentiment analysis. The hope is that _Plotter_ will provide both amateur and professional writers with the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses in their work, and the confidence to come up with solutions themselves.

# Instructions

To build and run the Microsoft Word add-in, run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm run``. If everything goes according to plan, Word will open up and _Plotter_ will be available in the top right of the Home tab.
